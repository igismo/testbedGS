The following is an 
<font color=red>
example </font>
of the kinds of information and explanations that we are looking for in answer to the Security Risks of the Project.  It is not intended to be copied verbatim.
</strong> 
<p>

The security risk of this experiment is minimal.  We will NOT be using
self propagating code.  Experiments will be on defense mechanisms, not
on attack methods.  The attack generation techniques that will be used
are those already used within DETER and will generate traffic destined
for nodes within DETER.  Exfiltration of such attack traffic would
impose only additional loading on links, and DETER is set up to prevent such traffic from getting out of the testbed.
