<h1>
    Reserving Nodes for a Large Experiment
</h1>
</center>
<p>
DETER was designed to accommodate large, long-running experiments, as
well as malware and other kinds of experiments that require exclusive
use of the testbed.  We do our best to accommodate these uses;  however,
we typically host a number of different experiments simultaneously, and
we have to balance the exclusive use of the testbed with our desire to
make resources available to many users.
<p>
If you require the exclusive use of the entire testbed, or plan to use
more than 64 nodes, or run experiments for longer than a week, please
contact the testbed staff, at 
<a href="mailto:testbed-ops@isi.deterlab.net"> Testbed Operations
(testbed-ops@isi.deterlab.net)</a>.
<p>
We are happy to make a reservation for experimenters to use the entire
testbed. Since this will require other people to swap out their
experiments, we try to give our users at least two weeks notice.  Please
give us *more* than two weeks notice.
<p>
Also, please understand that the longer your reservation, the more
advanced planning is required.  Using the testbed for 24 hours is not
too much of a problem;  reserving it for a week would require 
considerably more than two weeks notice to the staff.
<p>
Setting up exclusive access is usually a significant effort for the
testbed administrators, since we have to notify users, and then swap out
experiments, and possibly deal with any difficulties getting a large
experiment swapped in.  While we understand that things don't always go
as planned, we would appreciate it if you did some work to ensure that
your experiment will work.
<p>
If you are planning a large experiment, please try out your experiment
several times with smaller numbers of nodes (first < 64, then < 128,
perhaps) before asking for a reservation.  If you are planning a malware
experiment, please ensure that you've tested your malware (in a safe and
secure fashion -- perhaps with VMware on an isolated system?) elsewhere
to ensure that it will work with the images available at DETER. 
<p>
For both kinds of experiments (but especially for malware experiments),
the more details you can provide about your experiments, the more that
the testbed staff can do to help you to ensure that everything works
successfully.
