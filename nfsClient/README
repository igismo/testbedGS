docker-nfs-client
Docker image for a light NFS client (~10.9MB). By default NFS 4 is used.

Based on https://github.com/evq/nfs-client.

Usage
Build
$ docker build -t nfs-client .
Run
Basic example, mounting NFS within container:

$ docker run -it --privileged=true --net=host -v /mnt/nfs-1 -e SERVER=192.168.0.9 -e SHARE=movies nfs-client
Writing back to the host:

$ docker run -itd \
    --privileged=true \
    --net=host \
    --name nfs-movies \
    -v /media/nfs-movies:/mnt/nfs-1:shared \
    -e SERVER=192.168.0.9 \
    -e SHARE=movies \
      nfs-client

Take note of the historic 'NFS shares and volumes don't mix' (#4213) to use shared or rshared as needed when
needing to use --volumes-from with other containers. Additionally, after the container is killed you'll need
to unmount the host mount too.

Runtime Environment Variables
There should be a reasonable amount of flexibility using the available variables. If not please raise an issue
so your use case can be covered!

SERVER - the hostname of the NFS server to connect to
SHARE - the name of the NFS share to mount
MOUNT_OPTIONS - mount options to mount the NFS share with
FSTYPE - the filesystem type; specify nfs3 for NFSv3, default is nfs i.e. NFSv4
MOUNTPOINT - the mount point for the NFS share within the container
Tag and Push
$ docker tag -f nfs-client flaccid/nfs-client
$ docker push flaccid/nfs-client
